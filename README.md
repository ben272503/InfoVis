# InfoVis

page availaible at : https://ben272503.github.io/InfoVis/

inspiration to finish the last graph: https://codepen.io/bybelov/pen/MoXVLW

things that i could improve: 
- the scale on the 3D graph
- visual when a lot of things are on the screen
- the last graph on the France special page
- zoom on graphs

things that I could add: 
- export to picture
- a way to selecta country or 2 to be highlighted in the mess of 3D objects


Easter egg: 
-typing 'france' on the windows 'france special' show a demonstration.
